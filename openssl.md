# OpenSSL setup

Search Guard SSL can use Open SSL as the SSL implementation. This will result in better performance and better support for strong and modern cipher suites. With Open SSL its also possible to use strong chipers without installing Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files. 

To enable native support for Open SSL follow these steps:

## Dynamically linked

**(Open SSL and Apache Portable Runtime needs to be installed)**

* If you are on Alpine Linux pls. refer to [this post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/search-guard/dLr4SYeDMOE/915APogFBQAJ)
* Install latest 1.0.2 OpenSSL version on every node (1.0.1 does also work but is outdated). OpenSSL 1.1.x is not supported currently.
 *  [https://www.openssl.org/community/binaries.html](https://www.openssl.org/community/binaries.html)
* Install APR - Apache Portable Runtime (libapr1) on every node
 * [https://apr.apache.org](https://apr.apache.org)
 * On Ubuntu, Apache Portable Runtime can be installed with `sudo apt-get install libapr1`
* Download netty-tcnative for **your** platform and Search Guard version
 * Linux (non fedora based): `_linux-x86.jar_` (Debian, Ubuntu, ...) 
 * Fedora based linux: `_64-fedora.jar_` (RHEL, CentOS)
 * Mac: `_osx-x86_64.jar_`
 * Windows: `_windows-x86_64.jar_`
* **Search Guard 2:**
 * Version: 1.1.33.Fork17
 * http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/netty/netty-tcnative/1.1.33.Fork17/version, where version is one of `_linux-x86.jar_`, `_64-fedora.jar_`, `_osx-x86_64.jar_`
 or `_windows-x86_64.jar_` 
 * Put it into the elasticsearch `plugins/searchguard-ssl/` folder (on every node of course)
* **Search Guard 5:**
 * Version: 1.1.33.Fork23
 * http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/netty/netty-tcnative/1.1.33.Fork23/version, where version is one of `_linux-x86.jar_`, `_64-fedora.jar_`, `_osx-x86_64.jar_`
 or `_windows-x86_64.jar_`
 * Put it into the elasticsearch `plugins/search-guard-5/` folder (on every node of course)
* If you update the plugin (or re-install it after removal) don't forget to add netty-tcnative .jar again
* Check that you have enabled OpenSSL in the configuration
 * `searchguard.ssl.transport.enable_openssl_if_available: true`
 * `searchguard.ssl.http.enable_openssl_if_available: true`

## Statically linked

**(Only works for non-fedora based linux, does not need Open SSL/Apache Portable Runtime to be installed)**

* **Search Guard 2:**
 * Download [netty-tcnative-openssl-static-1.1.33.Fork17-linux-x86_64.jar compiled with OpenSSL 1.0.2j
](https://github.com/floragunncom/sg-assets/blob/master/netty-tcnative-openssl-static-linux-x86_64/netty-tcnative-openssl-static-1.1.33.Fork17-linux-x86_64.jar?raw=true) 
* **Search Guard 5:**
 * Download [netty-tcnative-openssl-static-1.1.33.Fork23-linux-x86_64.jar compiled with OpenSSL 1.0.2j
](https://github.com/floragunncom/sg-assets/blob/master/netty-tcnative-openssl-static-linux-x86_64/netty-tcnative-openssl-static-1.1.33.Fork23-linux-x86_64.jar?raw=true)
* Follow step 6-8 above

## Troubleshooting 

If you did all the steps above and start your nodes, you should see an entry similar to this in the logfile:

```
[INFO ][com.floragunn.searchguard.ssl.SearchGuardKeyStore] Open SSL OpenSSL 1.0.2d 9 Jul 2015 available
[INFO ][com.floragunn.searchguard.ssl.SearchGuardKeyStore] Open SSL available ciphers [ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384,...
```

If you face one of the following messages OpenSSL is not available and Search Guard SSL will use the built-in Java SSL implementation:

###java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.tomcat.jni.SSL
* netty-tcnative jar is missing, see above
* make sure you use the netty-tcnative jar **matching your platform**, either `_linux-x86.jar_` or `_64-fedora.jar_` or `_osx-x86_64.jar_` or `_windows-x86_64.jar_` 

###java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError
* OpenSSL is not installed, see above
* Apache Portable Runtime (APR) is not installed, see above

###Alpine Linux
Alpine Linux does not work out of the box. You need to compile the tc-native library yourself.
Pls. refer to [this post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/search-guard/dLr4SYeDMOE/915APogFBQAJ) and this github repository https://github.com/pires/netty-tcnative-alpine
